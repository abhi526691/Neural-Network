# Neural-Network
<b>Simple Neural Network without any hidden layer</b></br>
<p>It's a simple Neural network which doesn't contain any hidden layer within it.It's just 3 input's with a single output neurons in it</p></br>
<p>Inputs:x1,x2,x3</br>
Weight: W1,W2,W3</br>
bias:b1</br>
learning_rate:0.05</p>
<p>The activation function used is Sigmoid to limit the input value in between 0 to 1<p>
<p>The step involved in forming this neural network is:<p>
<p>step1:Import the necessary Packages:numpy, matplotlib, random</br>
step2:Initialize your input, output, weight, biases with random values</br>
step3:Complete Your Forward_propagation </br>
step4:complete Your Backward_propagation</br>
step5:Test your neural network with your input, it should come near to 0 or to 1</br>
